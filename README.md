API Endpoints
Here are some of the primary endpoints provided by the backend:

User Management

POST /api/register/ - Register a new user
POST /api/login/ - Log in an existing user
CKD Prediction

POST /api/predict/ - Submit medical data and receive a CKD prediction
Data Management

GET /api/data/ - Retrieve all submitted medical data
POST /api/data/ - Submit new medical data
For detailed API documentation, please refer to the API Documentation.

Model Training and Deployment
The machine learning model for CKD detection is trained separately from this Django backend. Follow these steps to train and deploy your model:

Train your model: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to train your model.
Export the model: Save the trained model to a file format suitable for loading in Django (e.g., .pkl).
Deploy the model: Load the model in your Django views or a dedicated module for prediction.
Refer to the notebooks directory for more details on model training.
